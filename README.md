# AIML-hw2

Second Assignment for the course "Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence" @Politecnico di Torino.

Image classification using Convolutional Neural Network.

*Main algorithms and techniques:* AlexNet, VGG, ResNet-50, Transfer Learning, Data Augmentation.
<br>
*Evaluation metrics:* Accuracy.
<br>
*Programming language and main libraries:* Python, Pytorch.

### Abstract

The purpose of this homework is to train a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification, tune some hyperparameters and evaluate the performance changes. Specifically, it will be considered firstly the Alexnet model and then some other types of CNNs such as VGG and ResNet. Moreover, some techniques such as Transfer Learning and Data Augmentation have been used in order to try to improve the model performance. The dataset considered is the Caltech-101 dataset, which is composed by about 9000 pictures of objects belonging to 101 categories with about 40 to 800 images per category.
